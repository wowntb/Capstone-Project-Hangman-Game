# Hangman Game
This is a game of hangman that I created using React for a capstone project of mine.
## Instructions
To run this game, head to the directory of the hangman game using a CLI and run the command "npm start". The game should automatically open in your browser. If it doesn't, type "http://localhost:3000/" in your address bar and hit enter.
## Game Instructions
This is a simple game of hangman. You must deduce what the word is by guessing letters and seeing if that letter is part of the word. You will have 10 attempts to get the word right before the man is hung. The progression of the image represents the user's failed attempts.
